## Template 1: MA Program Partnership

**Subject:** Collaborative MA Program in Computational Diachronic Linguistics

```
Dear Prof. [Last Name],

I'm reaching out because I noticed your excellent work on [specific paper/tool] 
and believe there's strong potential for collaboration.

I'm leading a CIVIS initiative to launch an Erasmus+ MA program focused on 
computational approaches to diachronic linguistics. Given [University]'s 
strengths in [specific area - e.g., NLP, digital humanities, historical 
linguistics], I think you would be an ideal partner.

The program combines:
• Traditional philological training
• Modern NLP techniques
• Hands-on corpus annotation
• Industry partnerships (CLARIN, Perseus, Europeana)

I've attached a 1-pager outlining the vision. Would you be open to a 15-minute 
call next week to explore potential synergies?

Best regards,
Nikos Lavidas
Professor of Linguistics

## Template 2: Research Consortium Invitation

**Subject:** Invitation: European Working Group on Computational Diachronic Linguistics

```
Dear [Name],

I'm assembling a working group of scholars interested in computational 
approaches to historical linguistics, modeled after CLARIN's Special 
Interest Groups.

Our goals:
• Standardize annotation pipelines for IE languages
• Organize annual hackathons
• Publish collaborative papers
• Develop open-source tools

Founding members include [University 1], [University 2], and [University 3].

Given your expertise in [specific area], I think you'd be a valuable addition 
to the group. Our kickoff meeting is tentatively planned for [Date] via Zoom.

Would you be interested in joining? I'm happy to share more details.

Best,
Nikos

```
Dear [Program Chair],

I'm writing to propose a keynote for [Conference Name] [Year] on the topic:

"Why Historical Linguists Must Code: Lessons from 2,500 Years of Greek"

Abstract (300 words):
[Insert abstract here]

This talk would showcase:
• Live demo of AI-powered corpus annotation
• Case studies from Ancient to Modern Greek
• Open-source tools for the community
• Future directions for computational philology

I've attached my CV and recent publications. I've previously keynoted at 
[Conference X] and [Conference Y] with excellent feedback.

I'm flexible on dates and happy to discuss the program committee's priorities.

Best regards,
Prof. Nikos Lavidas

## Template 4: Industry Partnership (Cultural Heritage)

**Subject:** Pilot Project: NLP Pipeline for Historical Greek Texts

```
Dear [Name],

I saw that [Organization - e.g., Google Arts & Culture] is working on 
[specific project]. I lead a research group at University of Athens 
specializing in computational philology for ancient texts.

We've developed an annotation platform that could enhance your project by:
• Automatically tagging morphology and syntax
• Linking to historical databases
• Enabling semantic search across centuries
• Providing ML-ready training data

Would you be interested in a pilot collaboration? We could start with a 
small corpus (10K tokens) at no cost to demonstrate the technology.

Our platform is open-source and has been used by [X students/researchers] 
across [Y countries].

I'm happy to send a demo video or arrange a call.

Best,

## Template 6: TEDx Application

**Subject:** TEDx Talk Proposal: "How AI Can Decode Lost Languages"

```
Dear TEDx [City] Organizers,

I'm a professor of linguistics at the University of Athens, and I'd like to 
propose a talk for your [Date] event:

Title: "How AI Can Decode Lost Languages"

Summary (500 words):
[Engaging story about computational philology, starting with a mystery about 
an undeciphered script, showing how AI is transforming the field, live demo 
of the platform analyzing Linear B, ending with implications for preserving 
endangered languages]

Why this matters to your audience:
• Intersection of AI and humanities (timely)
• Live demonstration (visually engaging)
• Connects ancient past to technological future
• Accessible to non-specialists

I've given talks to audiences of 500+ and have experience making complex
