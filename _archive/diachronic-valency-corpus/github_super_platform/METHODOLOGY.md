# Integrated Methodology

## ValPaL Approach
- 80 core verbal meanings
- Coding frames and alternations
- Microrole identification
- Cross-linguistic comparison

## DiGrec Periodization
1. **Archaic** (8th-6th c. BCE)
2. **Classical** (5th-4th c. BCE)  
3. **Hellenistic** (3rd-1st c. BCE)
4. **Roman** (1st-4th c. CE)
5. **Byzantine** (5th-15th c. CE)
6. **Modern** (16th c. - present)

## Diorisis Annotation Layers
- **L1**: Tokenization
- **L2**: Morphological analysis
- **L3**: Syntactic parsing
- **L4**: Semantic roles
- **L5**: Discourse relations
